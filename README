Site-Engine
===========

Site::Engine - Ugly tiny CGI-based web-framework with templates, sessions and
               databases.

This is simple CGI-based web-framework. It's syntax looks like Dancer
(http://perldancer.org). Use this only if your hosting has plain perl
and Apache with mod_cgi/mod_rewrite and doesn't provide support for
modern PSGI-based WF like Dancer or Mojolicious. Also, it will be easy
to migrate your code later to Dancer if needed.
